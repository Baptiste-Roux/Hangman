group size:        2

/!!\
- Your repository must contain the totality of your source files,
  but no useless files (binary, temp files, obj files,...).
- Error messages have to be written on the error output, and the program should
  then exit with the 84 error code (0 if there is no error).

/!!\
The $STUMPERNUMBER is always on one digit: 1, 2, ...

/!!\
For this project, the only authorized functions are those of the standard libC.

subject:
You must code a program in C that will take a dictionary as parameter (mandatory) and optionally a number of tries (10 by default).
Your program will retrieve all of the words defined in this file and will use it as a dictionary during the game.
The goal of the player is to find the word letter by letter before being hanged.
- Each of the dictionary's lines should only contain one word.
- The word used in the section will be randomly selected.
- Your program must let the player know the position of the letters he/she has already found, the total
  number of letters in the word and the number of tries he/she has left (see examples).
- You will read the letter guessed by the user on the standard input, and apply the modifications accordingly.

tips:
All text on the balise do not have to be print.
In this case "[user_entry]" indique you what the user of the program enter and end with "[\user_entry]"


Examples:

```Terminal
∼/B-CPE-210> cat file
butterfly
test
my_swap
∼/B-CPE-210> ./hangman file
*******
Tries: 10

Your letter: [user_entry]a[\user_entry]
*****a*
Tries: 10

Your letter: [user_entry]b[\user_entry]
b: is not in this word
*****a*
Tries: 9

Your letter: [user_entry]m[\user_entry]
m****a*
Tries: 9

Your letter: [user_entry]p[\user_entry]
m****ap
Tries: 9

[And so on, until:]
Your letter: [user_entry]m[\user_entry]
my_swap
Tries: 2

Congratulations!
∼/B-CPE-210> ./hangman file 1 2>/dev/null
****
Tries: 1

Your letter: [user_entry]v[\user_entry]
v: is not in this word
****
Tries: 0

You lost!
